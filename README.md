**AI Safety and Security: Intelligent Detection of Critical Events Using Audio-Visual Analysis**

# Problem Statement
Traditional surveillance systems depend heavily on human monitoring, which can lead to slow or missed responses during critical safety incidents such as violence, accidents, or fires. Our project introduces an AI-based model capable of detecting critical or abnormal events by analyzing both audio and video data simultaneously. The system can identify emergencies like loud crashes, fighting, or fire , and generate real-time alerts. This approach aims to improve situational awareness, enhance safety, and reduce the need for constant manual supervision.
